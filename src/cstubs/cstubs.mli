(** [write_ml fmt ~prefix bindings] generates ML bindings for the functions
    bound with [foreign] in [bindings].  The generated code conforms to the
    {!FOREIGN} interface.

val write_enum : Format.formatter -> prefix:string -> (module BINDINGS) -> unit
(** Write a C enum definition with one enumeration constant for each foreign
    binding and one enumeration constant giving the number of entries. *)

val write_frame_structs : Format.formatter -> prefix:string -> (module BINDINGS) -> unit
(** Write a C struct definition to hold the function identifier, arguments and
    return type for each foreign binding and a variable giving the struct of
    the largest struct. *)

val write_remote_dispatcher : Format.formatter -> prefix:string -> (module BINDINGS) -> unit
(** Write a definition of a C function that reads a call frame struct from a
    buffer and dispatches to the appropriate function. *)
